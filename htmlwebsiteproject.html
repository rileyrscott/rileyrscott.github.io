    <p>URSA Mini Pro has been designed to be the toughest and most fully featured camera available. Everything you need is built right in, so you don’t have to carry around a lot of extra production equipment. Plus, every single control on the camera is redundant, including the power, so if anything should go wrong in the field, you’ll still have backups to get the shot! You get dual card recorders, battery and power, multiple screens, fully redundant controls and you can even swap lens mounts, all built into a lightweight and super strong magnesium alloy body. URSA Mini Pro is the only camera in the world that combines digital film image quality with a durable compact high end broadcast style design that’s built for reliability, mobility and speed of use, so you can focus on being more creative!</p>
